## Build blockchain Vehicle sharing Application

Transport is the backbone of any modern economy. Those who do own cars seem never to use them anyway, preferring public transport, ride-hailing and car sharing for daily use. [According to studies, even in 2013](https://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html), cars were parked 95% of the time. But cars are not going away for the time being and we still need them to be mobile. And this is why thereâ€™s been quite a bit of discussion in the transportation sector on how to improve the efficiency of car usage.
